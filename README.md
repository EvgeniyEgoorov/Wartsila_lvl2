A simple solution for the Account Manager REST API, created using the Django Rest Framework. I solved the task as part of jod interview. 


## Initial requirements:

- display a list of all accounts
- display account information by ID
- provide the ability to add an account
- provide the ability to change the account
- provide the ability to delete an account
- provide account search by one or more attributes

## Guide:
The list of available API methods and their description are presented in `requests.http`.
To send HTTP requests, I used the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) for Visual Studio Code.
