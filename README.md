## Guide:
The list of available API methods and their description are presented in `requests.http'.
To send HTTP requests, I used the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) for Visual Studio Code.

## Task condition:
To design an API for a simple account manager (users)


#### The API should allow:

- display a list of all accounts

- display account information by ID

- provide the ability to add an account

- provide the ability to change the account

- provide the ability to delete an account

- provide account search by one or more attributes
